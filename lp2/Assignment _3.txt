Experiment: 3
Implement Greedy search algorithm for any of the following
application: Selection Sort

CODE:
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, roll_number):
        self.name = name
        self.roll_number = roll_number

# Function to perform selection sort on a list of Student objects based on roll number
def selection_sort(students):
    n = len(students)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        min_index = i
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if students[j].roll_number < students[min_index].roll_number:
                min_index = j
        # Swap the students at min_index and i
        students[min_index], students[i] = students[i], students[min_index]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    num_students = int(input("Enter the number of students: "))
    
    students = []
    for i in range(num_students):
        name = input(f"Enter name of student {i + 1}: ")
        roll_number = int(input(f"Enter roll number of student {i + 1}: "))
        students.append(Student(name, roll_number))
    
    print("\nStudents before sorting:")
    for student in students:
        print(f"Name: {student.name}, Roll Number: {student.roll_number}")
    
    selection_sort(students)
    
    print("\nStudents after sorting by roll number:")
    for student in students:
        print(f"Name: {student.name}, Roll Number: {student.roll_number}")


OUTPUT:
Enter the number of students: 4
Enter name of student 1: Sakshi
Enter roll number of student 1: 45
Enter name of student 2: Tejal
Enter roll number of student 2: 23
Enter name of student 3: Gautami
Enter roll number of student 3: 15
Enter name of student 4: Prerana
Enter roll number of student 4: 65

Students before sorting:
Name: Sakshi, Roll Number: 45
Name: Tejal, Roll Number: 23
Name: Gautami, Roll Number: 15
Name: Prerana, Roll Number: 65

Students after sorting by roll number:
Name: Gautami, Roll Number: 15
Name: Tejal, Roll Number: 23
Name: Sakshi, Roll Number: 45
Name: Prerana, Roll Number: 65
